Great follow-up! Here's a more **comprehensive list of legal document types** found on websites ‚Äî beyond the ones already in your README ‚Äî along with insights on whether Python libraries exist to **categorize or classify** them.

## ü§ñ Python Libraries for Classifying or Parsing Legal Documents

### 1. **`Presidio` by Microsoft**

* NLP tool for detecting sensitive data (PII) in documents
* Can tag and extract policy-relevant entities like names, emails, GDPR terms
* Not document-type classification, but useful for legal data detection

### 2. **`lexnlp`**

* Focused on parsing **contracts and legal text**
* Can extract clauses like termination dates, governing law, parties
* Great for **contract mining**, legal analytics
* [https://github.com/LexPredict/lexpredict-lexnlp](https://github.com/LexPredict/lexpredict-lexnlp)

### 3. **`Grobid` + Python Wrappers**

* Extracts and classifies structured information from scholarly/legal documents (PDF)
* Good for large-scale document processing

### 4. **LangChain + Text Classification (custom)**

* You can build a classifier using keyword detection or fine-tuned models:

```python
if "shipping" in text.lower() or "delivery" in text.lower():
    doc_type = "Shipping Policy"
elif "warranty" in text.lower():
    doc_type = "Warranty Policy"
```

* You can improve this using **zero-shot classification** with HuggingFace:

```python
from transformers import pipeline
classifier = pipeline("zero-shot-classification")
classifier("This policy covers data storage for EU users.", candidate_labels=["Privacy Policy", "GDPR Statement", "Cookie Policy"])
```

## üß† Bonus: Use LLM to Auto-Detect Document Type

```python
prompt = f"""
What type of legal document is this?

{text}

Options: Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, Refund Policy, Cookie Policy, DMCA Policy, GDPR Policy, Other
"""
```

---

## ‚úÖ Recommendations

* **Start with keyword heuristics** for document-type classification
* Add **zero-shot classification** using HuggingFace models like `facebook/bart-large-mnli`
* Use **LexNLP** if dealing with contracts or formal legal docs
* Use **Presidio** to tag privacy-sensitive fields
